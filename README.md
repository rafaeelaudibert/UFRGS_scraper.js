# UFRGS - Vestibular Scraper

Scraper written in JavaScript using [Bun](https://bun.sh) to fetch all freshmen from the UFRGS vestibular.

This code is tested to run on UFRGS's "Listão" from the 2022 to the 2025 editions.
There are no warranties that it will run in future editions, as this is only a scraper and depends on the website layout, which can be changed by UFRGS at any time.

> **NOTE:** A previous version worked for the years between 2016 and 2021, but that version stopped working recently.
> You might check it by looking at previous commits.

## Prerequisites

You must have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your computer. You can install it by running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

---

## Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaeelaudibert/UFRGS_scraper.js.git
cd UFRGS_scraper.js
bun install
```

---

## Running the code

Run the scraper by passing the `YEAR` environment variable inline:

```bash
YEAR=2025 bun start
```

Replace `2025` with the desired year. **Only 2022 and later are supported** — the scraper will fail for any year before 2022.

> 💡 **Older years:** For years between 2016 and 2021, check out previous commits in this repository.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The code will erase any folder named `./json` in the root of the project. Make sure you don't have important data there before running. Type `YES` when prompted to confirm.

## Understanding the data

The data generated by the code is pretty easy to understand. It will generate a folder tree like so:

```
./json
  |
  \- course1
      |
      \- freshmen.json
      \- freshmen.txt
  |- course2
  |- course3
  |- course4
```

\
Each course will have its own folder containing 2 files: `freshmen.json` and `freshmen.txt`. The former has the following structure:

```json
[
    {
        "name": "First freshman name",
        "semester": "First freshman semester (1º or 2º)",
    },
    {
        "name": "Second freshman name",
        "semester": "Second freshman semester (1º or 2º)",
    },
    {
        ...
    },
    ...
]
```

\
The latter is a plain text file containing one freshman name per line, _without the semester_, as follows:

```text
    First freshman name
    Second freshman name
    Third freshman name
    ...
```

## Disclaimer

This program is not associated with the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul in any ways, and it was just created to more easily fetch the freshmen through the popular Listão do Vestibular.
